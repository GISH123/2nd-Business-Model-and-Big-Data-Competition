#建議從 NOW try to fit a model on my dataset 那邊開始看
# its very disorganized and i just modify the code whereever i want, so you probably shouldnt look at this,  
# and the last modification i fitted a bad model(by tuning bad parameters) so the result here is pretty garbage  
but it has some results which you can see  

# 這只是讓你看看大概長什麼樣子而已，但是裡面有用到一些你一定得跑程式才會畫出來的圖表，所以還是請你直接執行上一個資料夾的catboost_organized_for_upload吧
